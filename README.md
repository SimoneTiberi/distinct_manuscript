This repository contains the code used for the analyses presented in the manuscript "distinct: a novel approach to differential distribution analyses", which presents the differential distribution analyses R/Bioconductor package distinct.

The scripts are organized in five folders:

- `CDF plots` contains the code to plot the differential profiles;

- `diffcyt semi-simulated data` contains the code to perform the `diffcyt` simulation study;

- `Kang dataset - exploratory plots` contains the code to perform some exploratory plots of the `Kang` dataset;

- `muscat simulation and Kang real data` contains the snakemakes and the code to perform all `muscat` simulation studies and the `Kang` non-null real data analysis (comparing controls to stimulated samples);

- `NULL experimental data` contains the code to run the null analyses on the real `T-cells` and `Kang` datasets.
